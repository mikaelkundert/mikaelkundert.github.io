      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember when last time I actually had a homepage with actual content. It must been over 10 years before I started to work full time professionally on web development.
Why now again? This month, Google opened .dev TLD for anyone who wants a .dev domain. I decided to buy one to myself just in case if I want to use it.
After purchase, it took me couple of hours until I started to wonder, why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have homepage?</description>
